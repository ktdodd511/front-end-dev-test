> A Vue.js project

## To run:
### 1. Clone this repository.
### 2. Run 'npm install'
### 3. Run 'npm start'

## Write up:
### 1. I used Vue.JS because I'm currently learning how to use it so I wanted to further develop my skills.
### 2. I struggled with making the app responsive, as I'm still not that familiar with Vue and I also don't think I utilized Vue correctly. Looking back, I should've create more components. I also had trouble deploying to Heroku. I've only ever deployed Rails applications, and after much troubleshooting, I was still unable to get the app to display on Heroku.
### 3. Overall, I like using Vue, it's sort of similar to Bootstrap, using columns and rows, and I also like that there are plenty of libraries available to use with Vue. It reminds me of Ruby Gems.
